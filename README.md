#### David Roberts - Pirium Systems React test

node version: 12.2.0
yarn version: 1.15.2

## Things I would have like to have done:

* There are a few TODO comments in the code which would highlight some issues
* I've only tested on Chrome latest, but a technology like browserlist would help with the babel complier, plus IE fallbacks for CSS
* CSS transitions for the expand / collapse would be nice
